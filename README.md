Swatch is an (hopefully) very simple wrapper around the
[Java 7 WatchService API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/notification.html).

Binaries are available on [Bintray](https://bintray.com/pkg/show/general/mcaserta/github-releases/swatch).

Inclusion in build.sbt: 

```sbt

libraryDependencies += "com.mirkocaserta.swatch" %% "swatch" % "1.0.2-SNAPSHOT"

```

Usage is pretty straightforward:

```scala
import com.mirkocaserta.swatch.Swatch._

watch("plugins", Seq(Create, Modify, Delete), println, true)
```

This registers a [WatchService](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/WatchService.html)
on the `plugins` directory and its subdirectories (because of
the `true` value being passed to the `recursive` argument).
The `WatchService` will then watch for creation, modification and
deletion of files. Notifications will get sent to the `println`
function.

If you want to (and you sure will) customize your notifications
listener, it's as easy as defining a function such as:

```scala
import com.mirkocaserta.swatch.Swatch._

val listener = (event: SwatchEvent) ⇒ {
  println(s"got an event: $event")

  event match {
    case Create(path) ⇒ println(s"a file was created with path '$path'")
    case Modify(path) ⇒ println(s"a file was modified with path '$path'")
    case Delete(path) ⇒ println(s"a file was deleted with path '$path'")
  }
}

watch("plugins", Seq(Create, Modify, Delete), listener, true)
```

An actor wrapper is also provided. Usage looks like this:

```scala
import akka.actor.{Props, ActorSystem}
import com.mirkocaserta.swatch.Swatch._
import com.mirkocaserta.swatch.SwatchActor

val swatch = system.actorOf(Props[SwatchActor])
swatch ! Watch("plugins", Seq(Create, Modify, Delete), true)
```

Your sending actor will then start receiving `SwatchEvent`
messages. You can optionally specify a different actor to
be notified of `SwatchEvent`s, via the optional `listener`
parameter.

If you need further info, take a look at the scaladocs in the 
source code. I've tried to make it as estensive as possible.
